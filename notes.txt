there are 4 pillars of advance javascript.

1.callback
2.promise
3.fetch api
4.async/await=> it is an alternative for fetch=> syntatcic sugar=> easiest way to write a code.
returns a promise,,,, await=> .then
error handling=> try catch

syntax: async function functionname(){
    await fetch(url)
}

what is fetch? it is an alternate method for XHR
to get datas from an api .

old method=> XHR=> output object=> used for client server communication
request, open, send, onload=> it is a time consuming process.
to overcome this , fetch is introduced.

syntax: fetch("api url")

fetch is always returns a promise
inisde the promise , inisde the body , the dats are in readable stream format
we cant do anything with this. we need a data format output.
we have to change this into json format.
for that we have to chage this into .json() method.

before that we ahve to j=handle thos fetch.(.then 2 times)

mockapi=> CRUD=> create, read , update,delete.
